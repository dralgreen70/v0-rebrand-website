## From Personal Trainer to Physician

My path to medicine was anything but conventional. Before medical school, I served in the Active Duty Air Force as a squadron physical training leader and worked as a personal trainer. Those experiences shaped a fundamental belief: **health optimization requires a holistic, multi-system approach**.

I envisioned becoming a "super personal trainer" who could optimize people's lives from every angle. That vision led me to medical school, and ultimately to therapeutic plasma exchange.

## Discovering Therapeutic Plasma Exchange

During medical school, I encountered the research on parabiosis — the Stanford experiments connecting the circulatory systems of old and young mice. The results were extraordinary: old mice showed signs of biological rejuvenation. This was the spark.

I realized that therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) could achieve something similar in humans — not by connecting circulatory systems, but by systematically removing the accumulated harmful proteins, inflammatory cytokines, and senescent factors from aging plasma and replacing it with clean albumin solution.

## Training Under the Best

I was fortunate to complete my residency at **UT Southwestern** under Dr. Ravi Sarode, one of the world's foremost experts in apheresis and transfusion medicine. This training gave me:

- Deep expertise in the technical aspects of apheresis procedures
- Understanding of the immunological mechanisms behind plasma exchange
- Clinical experience managing complex patient cases
- A rigorous, evidence-based approach to emerging applications

## The Kiprov Connection

During this period, I established a professional relationship with **Dr. Dobri Kiprov**, a true pioneer in therapeutic plasma exchange. Dr. Kiprov's decades of work advancing PLEX for conditions beyond its traditional applications opened my eyes to the transformative potential of this therapy.

His mentorship has been invaluable in shaping my approach to apheresis medicine, particularly in the longevity and health optimization space.

## Building at Lifespan Edge

In 2025, I helped launch and scale the flagship longevity clinic in Dallas, TX — taking the therapeutic plasma exchange program from zero to 50 procedures per month. This experience taught me the operational, clinical, and patient-experience dimensions of scaling apheresis services.

## Joining Global Apheresis

Now, as **Associate Medical Director at Global Apheresis**, I'm leading comprehensive apheresis programs that go beyond TPE alone. Our portfolio includes:

- **Therapeutic Plasma Exchange (TPE/PLEX)** — Our cornerstone procedure for longevity, Alzheimer's, and inflammation
- **Cellular Collections** — Specialized white blood cell and stem cell collection services
- **Lipid Apheresis** — Targeted removal of excess lipids for cardiovascular risk reduction

We're working with leading biotechnology companies to advance emerging stem cell protocols and lipid apheresis technologies — pushing the boundaries of what's possible in precision apheresis medicine.

## Looking Forward

The science is clear: what circulates in your blood profoundly affects how you age and how you heal. At Global Apheresis, we're not just performing procedures — we're building the future of preventative medicine, one exchange at a time.

I'm honored to be part of a team that's making comprehensive apheresis accessible to more patients, advancing research, and training the next generation of apheresis physicians.
